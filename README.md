## Basic examples

 - **connect** - Connect to a messaging server
 - **send** - Send a message
 - **receive** - Receive messages
 - **request** - Send a request and receive a response
 - **respond** - Receive requests and send responses

## Connect

Establish a connection, print to the console when connected, and exit.

Usage: `connect <connection-url>`

        $ python connect.py amqp://example.net
        CONNECT: Connected to 'amqp://example.net'

## Send

Send one message and exit.

Usage: `send <connection-url> <address> <message-body>`

        $ python send.py amqp://example.net examples "Hello there"
        SEND: Connected to 'amqp://example.net'
        SEND: Opened sender for target address 'examples'
        SEND: Sent message 'Hello there'

## Receive

Receive messages until the program is terminated.  If specified, exit
after `<message-count>` messages are received.


Usage: `receive <connection-url> <address> [<message-count>]`

        $ python receive.py amqp://example.net examples
        RECEIVE: Connected to 'amqp://example.net'
        RECEIVE: Opened receiver for source address 'examples'
        RECEIVE: Received message 'Hello there'

## Request

Send one request, receive the response, print the response to the
console, and exit.

Usage: `request <connection-url> <address> <message-body>`

        $ python request.py amqp://example.net examples "abcdef"
        REQUEST: Connected to 'amqp://example.net'
        REQUEST: Opened sender for target address 'examples'
        REQUEST: Sent request message 'abcdef'
        REQUEST: Received response message 'ABCDEF'

## Respond

Receive requests and send responses until the program is terminated.
If specified, exit after `<message-count>` messages are received.

Usage: `respond <connection-url> <address> [<message-count>]`

        $ python respond.py amqp://example.net examples
        RESPOND: Connected to 'amqp://example.net'
        RESPOND: Opened receiver for source address 'examples'
        RESPOND: Received request message 'abcdef'
        RESPOND: Sent response message 'ABCDEF'

## General properties

 - The most basic sending programs send one message and then exit.

 - By default, receiving programs keep running until the user
   terminates them.  If the optional MESSAGE-COUNT argument is
   supplied, they exit after the given number of messages have been
   received.

 - Each example program is contained in a single file, with exceptions
   where necessary.

 - Option parsing is deliberately simple, using positional arguments.
